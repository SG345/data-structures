/**
*The maximum sub-array is the problem in which we aim to get the sub-array which has the maximum sum
*The elements of the sub-array should be a mix of negative as well as positive numbers otherwise a set of positive numbers would yield the entire array as the maximum sub-array
*It uses the divide and conquer approach
*The time complexity is O(nlg n); where lg n is the log of n to base 2
