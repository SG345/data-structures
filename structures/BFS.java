*<h1>Breadth First Traversal For a Graph</h1>
*<p>
*Breadth-first search is a way to find all the vertices reachable from the a given source vertex. 
*the basic idea of the breath-first search is this: send a wave out from source s. The wave hits all vertices 1 edge from s. From there, the wave hits all vertices 2 edges from s and so on.
*In Peer to Peer Networks like BitTorrent, Breadth First Search is used to find all neighbor nodes.
